The data that ths Maculate Grid relies on comes from a public repo provided by nflverse. I use the player season stats data specifically for this project but the repo has even more detailed data from current and past seasons. All of this data can be accessed and downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases).
