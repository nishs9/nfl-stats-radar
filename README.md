# NFL Stats Radar

A project for visualizing NFL player statistics. The main feature of this web app is the ability to view the statistical profiles of all QBs, RBs, WRs, and TEs since 1999. The app is built using Next.js and Typescript. The backend consists of a simple SQLite DB that is made up of data from NFLverse's data repository (see References section for more info). I currently have the app deployed as a live demo using Railway.

The data that NFL Stats Radar relies on comes from a public repo provided by nflverse. I use the player season stats data specifically for this project but the repo has even more detailed data from current and past seasons. All of this data can be accessed and downloaded from [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases).
